Schools are ranked based on their water consumption per student over the last seven days in ascending order. The position of the user’s school in the ranked list is highlighted. Note that only working school days are considered in that calculation. In the same page a chart is shown which compares the water consumption of the user’s school to the average water consumption of all schools participating in the competition, as well as to the water consumption of the best 20% of the schools in terms of consumption."%}</h6><br>

Schools are ranked based on their water consumption change per student over the last seven days in ascending order. Again, the position of the user’s school in the ranked list is highlighted, while only working school days are considered. In the same page a chart is shown which compares the percentile water consumption change of the user’s school to the average percentile water consumption change of all schools participating in the competition, as well as to the percentile water consumption change of the best 20% of the schools in terms of percentile consumption change. Different colors are used to reflect a positive and a negative change corresponding to a consumption increase or decrease respectively." %} </h6><br>

The first type of rewards will be given to the school(s) that achieved the higher percentile consumption change over the duration of the competition. The second type of rewards will be based on the reports/videos that the competing school students will prepare at the end of the competition. Each school should create a video, or write a report, explaining what they did to achieve water consumption reduction, as well as any other ideas for further water consumption reduction in the future. For each school participating in the competition, one or two teams of students will be selected to represent their school. The first type of rewards will be a robotic kit for the best performing primary school(s), and a 3D printer for the best performing secondary schools. The second type of rewards will be given to the team of students that will write the best report or create the best video. This type of rewards would be Amazon or similar vouchers." %} </h6><br>
